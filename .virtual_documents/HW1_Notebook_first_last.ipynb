# A
print("Hello World"





# corrected:
print("Hello World")


# B
print("Hello")
    print("Goodbye")


Answer: there should not be an indent for print("Goodbye")


# corrected:
print("Hello")
print("Goodbye")


# C
x = 10
if x > 8
    print("x is greater than 8")


Answer: we need to have : for a an if statement in python


# corrected:
x = 10 
if x > 8:
    print("x is greater than 8")


# D
if x = 10:
    print("x is equal to 10")


Answer: comparison operator is == in python not =


# corrected:
if x == 10:
    print("x is equal to 10")


# E
x = 5
if x == 5:
print("x is five")


Answer: print funtion is within the if statement when the condition is met, therefore we need an indent to indicate that it is a part of the if statement


# corrected:
x = 5
if x == 5:
    print("x is five")


# F
l = [1, 2, 50, 10]
l = sort(l)


Answer: we use l.sort() to sort and modify the list 


# corrected:
l = [1, 2, 50, 10]
l.sort()
l
